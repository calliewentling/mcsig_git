<h1>Processes And Threading<a class="headerlink" href="#processes-and-threading" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Apache can operate in a number of different modes dependent on the platform
being used and the way in which it is configured. This ranges from multiple
processes being used, with only one request being handled at a time within
each process, to one or more processes being used, with concurrent requests
being handled in distinct threads executing within those processes.</p>
<p>The combinations possible are further increased by mod_wsgi through its
ability to create groups of daemon processes to which WSGI applications can
be delegated. As with Apache itself, each process group can consist of one
or more processes and optionally make use of multithreading. Unlike Apache,
where some combinations are only possible based on how Apache was compiled,
the mod_wsgi daemon processes can operate in any mode based only on runtime
configuration settings.</p>
<p>This article provides background information on how Apache and mod_wsgi
makes use of processes and threads to handle requests, and how Python
sub interpreters are used to isolate WSGI applications. The implications
of the various modes of operation on data sharing is also discussed.</p>
<div class="section" id="wsgi-process-thread-flags">
<h2>WSGI Process/Thread Flags<a class="headerlink" href="#wsgi-process-thread-flags" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Although Apache can make use of a combination of processes and/or threads
to handle requests, this is not unique to the Apache web server and the
WSGI specification acknowledges this fact. This acknowledgement is in the
form of specific key/value pairs which must be supplied as part of the WSGI
environment to a WSGI application. The purpose of these key/value pairs is
to indicate whether the underlying web server does or does not make use of
multiple processes and/or multiple threads to handle requests.</p>
<p>These key/value pairs are defined as follows in the WSGI specification.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><em>wsgi.multithread</em></dt>
<dd>This value should evaluate true if the application object may be
simultaneously invoked by another thread in the same process, and
should evaluate false otherwise.</dd>
<dt><em>wsgi.multiprocess</em></dt>
<dd>This value should evaluate true if an equivalent application object may
be simultaneously invoked by another process, and should evaluate false
otherwise.</dd>
</dl>
<p>A WSGI application which is not written to take into consideration the
different combinations of process and threading models may not be portable
and potentially may not be robust when deployed to an alternate hosting
platform or configuration.</p>
<p>Although you may not need an application or application component to work
under all possible combinations for these values initially, it is highly
recommended that any application component still be designed to work under
any of the different operating modes. If for some reason this cannot be
done due to the very nature of what functionality the component provides,
the component should validate if it is being run within a compatible
configuration and return a HTTP 500 internal server error response if it
isn’t.</p>
<p>An example of a component for which restrictions would apply is one
providing an interactive browser based debugger session in response to an
internal failure of a WSGI application. In this scenario, for the component
to work correctly, subsequent HTTP requests must be processed by the same
process. As such, the component can only be used with a web server that
uses a single process. In other words, the value of ‘wsgi.multiprocess’
would have to evaluate to be false.</p>

<div class="section" id="multi-processing-modules">
<h2>Multi-Processing Modules<a class="headerlink" href="#multi-processing-modules" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The main factor which determines how Apache operates is which
multi-processing module (MPM) is built into Apache at compile time.
Although runtime configuration can customise the behaviour of the MPM, the
choice of MPM will dictate whether or not multithreading is available.</p>
<p>On UNIX based systems, Apache defaults to being built with the ‘prefork’
MPM. If Apache 1.3 is being used this is actually the only choice, but for
later versions of Apache, this can be overridden at build time by supplying
an appropriate value in conjunction with the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--with-mpm</span></code> option when
running the ‘configure’ script for Apache. The main alternative to the
‘prefork’ MPM which can be used on UNIX systems is the ‘worker’ MPM.</p>
<p>If you are unsure which MPM is built into Apache, it can be determined
by running the Apache web server executable with the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-V</span></code> option. The
output from running the web server executable with this option will be
information about how it was configured when built:</p>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Which MPM is being used can be determined from the ‘Server MPM’ field.</p>
<p>On the Windows platform the only available MPM is ‘winnt’.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-unix-prefork-mpm">
<h2>The UNIX ‘prefork’ MPM<a class="headerlink" href="#the-unix-prefork-mpm" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This MPM is the most commonly used. It was the only mode of operation
available in Apache 1.3 and is still the default mode on UNIX systems in
later versions of Apache. In this configuration, the main Apache process
will at startup create multiple child processes. When a request is received
by the parent process, it will be processed by which ever of the child
processes is ready.</p>
<p>Each child process will only handle one request at a time. If another
request arrives at the same time, it will be handled by the next available
child process. When it is detected that the number of available processes
is running out, additional child processes will be created as necessary. If
a limit is specified as to the number of child processes which may be
created and the limit is reached, plus there are sufficient requests
arriving to fill up the listener socket queue, the client may instead
receive an error resulting from not being able to establish a connection
with the web server.</p>
<p>Where additional child processes have to be created due to a peak in the
number of current requests arriving and where the number of requests has
subsequently dropped off, the excess child processes may be shutdown and
killed off. Child processes may also be shutdown and killed off after they
have handled some set number of requests.</p>
<p>Although threads are not used to service individual requests, this does not
preclude an application from creating separate threads to perform some
specific task.</p>
<p>For the typical ‘prefork’ configuration where multiple processes are used,
the WSGI environment key/value pairs indicating how processes and threads
are being used will be as follows.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><em>wsgi.multithread</em></dt>
<dd>False</dd>
<dt><em>wsgi.multiprocess</em></dt>
<dd>True</dd>
</dl>
<p>Because multiple processes are being used, a WSGI middleware component such
as the interactive browser based debugger described would not be able to be
used. If during development and testing of a WSGI application, use of such a
debugger was required, the only option which would exist would be to limit
the number of processes being used. This could be achieved using the Apache
configuration:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">StartServers</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="n">ServerLimit</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>With this configuration, only one process will be started, with no
additional processes ever being created. The WSGI environment key/value
pairs indicating how processes and threads are being used will for this
configuration be as follows.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><em>wsgi.multithread</em></dt>
<dd>False</dd>
<dt><em>wsgi.multiprocess</em></dt>
<dd>False</dd>
</dl>
<p>In effect, this configuration has the result of serialising all requests
through a single process. This will allow an interactive browser based
debugger to be used, but may prevent more complex WSGI applications which
make use of AJAX techniques from working. This could occur where a web page
initiates a sequence of AJAX requests and expects later requests to be able
to complete while a response for an initial request is still pending. In
other words, problems may occur where requests overlap, as subsequent
requests will not be able to be executed until the initial request has
completed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-unix-worker-mpm">
<h2>The UNIX ‘worker’ MPM<a class="headerlink" href="#the-unix-worker-mpm" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The ‘worker’ MPM is similar to ‘prefork’ mode except that within each child
process there will exist a number of worker threads. Instead of a request
only being able to be processed by the next available idle child process
and with the handling of the request being the only thing the child process
is then doing, the request may be processed by a worker thread within a
child process which already has other worker threads handling other
requests at the same time.</p>
<p>It is possible that a WSGI application could be executed at the same time
from multiple worker threads within the one child process. This means that
multiple worker threads may want to access common shared data at the same
time. As a consequence, such common shared data must be protected in a way
that will allow access and modification in a thread safe manner. Normally
this would necessitate the use of some form of synchronisation mechanism to
ensure that only one thread at a time accesses and or modifies the common
shared data.</p>
<p>If all worker threads within a child process were busy when a new request
arrives the request would be processed by an idle worker thread in another
child process. Apache may still create new child processes on demand if
necessary. Apache may also still shutdown and kill off excess child
processes, or child processes that have handled more than a set number of
requests.</p>
<p>Overall, use of ‘worker’ MPM will result in less child processes needing to
be created, but resource usage of individual child processes will be
greater. On modern computer systems, the ‘worker’ MPM would in general be
the prefered MPM to use and should if possible be used in preference to the
‘prefork’ MPM.</p>
<p>Although contention for the global interpreter lock (GIL) in Python can
causes issues for pure Python programs, it is not generally as big an issue
when using Python within Apache. This is because all the underlying
infrastructure for accepting requests and mapping the URL to a WSGI
application, as well as the handling of requests against static files are
all performed by Apache in C code. While this code is being executed the
thread will not be holding the Python GIL, thus allowing a greater level of
overlapping execution where a system has multiple CPUs or CPUs with
multiple cores.</p>
<p>This ability to make good use of more than processor, even when using
multithreading, is further enchanced by the fact that Apache uses multiple
processes for handling requests and not just a single process. Thus, even
when there is some contention for the GIL within a specific process, it
doesn’t stop other processes from being able to run as the GIL is only
local to a process and does not extend across processes.</p>
<p>For the typical ‘worker’ configuration where multiple processes and
multiple threads are used, the WSGI environment key/value pairs indicating
how processes and threads are being used will be as follows.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><em>wsgi.multithread</em></dt>
<dd>True</dd>
<dt><em>wsgi.multiprocess</em></dt>
<dd>True</dd>
</dl>
<p>Similar to the ‘prefork’ MPM, the number of processes can be restricted
to just one if required using the configuration:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">StartServers</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="n">ServerLimit</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>With this configuration, only one process will be started, with no
additional processes ever being created, but that one process would still
make use of multiple threads.</p>
<p>The WSGI environment key/value pairs indicating how processes and threads
are being used will for this configuration be as follows.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><em>wsgi.multithread</em></dt>
<dd>True</dd>
<dt><em>wsgi.multiprocess</em></dt>
<dd>False</dd>
</dl>
<p>Because multiple threads are being used, there would be no problem with
overlapping requests generated by an AJAX based web page.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-windows-winnt-mpm">
<h2>The Windows ‘winnt’ MPM<a class="headerlink" href="#the-windows-winnt-mpm" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>On the Windows platform the ‘winnt’ MPM is the only option available. With
this MPM, multiple worker threads within a child process are used to handle
all requests. The ‘winnt’ MPM is different to the ‘worker’ mode however in
that there is only one child process. At no time are additional child
processes created, or that one child process shutdown and killed off,
except where Apache as a whole is being stopped or restarted. Because there
is only one child process, the maximum number of threads used is much
greater.</p>
<p>The WSGI environment key/value pairs indicating how processes and threads
are being used will for this configuration be as follows.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><em>wsgi.multithread</em></dt>
<dd>True</dd>
<dt><em>wsgi.multiprocess</em></dt>
<dd>False</dd>

<h2>The mod_wsgi Daemon Processes<a class="headerlink" href="#the-mod-wsgi-daemon-processes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When using ‘daemon’ mode of mod_wsgi, each process group can be
individually configured so as to run in a manner similar to either
‘prefork’, ‘worker’ or ‘winnt’ MPMs for Apache. This is achieved by
controlling the number of processes and threads within each process
using the ‘processes’ and ‘threads’ options of the WSGIDaemonProcess
directive.</p>
<p>To emulate the same process/thread model as the ‘winnt’ MPM, that is,
a single process with multiple threads, the following configuration would
be used:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">WSGIDaemonProcess</span> <span class="n">example</span> <span class="n">threads</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">25</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The WSGI environment key/value pairs indicating how processes and threads
are being used will for this configuration be as follows.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><em>wsgi.multithread</em></dt>
<dd>True</dd>
<dt><em>wsgi.multiprocess</em></dt>
<dd>False</dd>
</dl>
<p>Note that by not specifying the ‘processes’ option only a single process is
created within the process group. Although providing ‘processes=1’ as an
option would also result in a single process being created, this has a
slightly different meaning and so you should only do this if necessary.</p>
<p>The difference between not specifying the ‘processes’ option and defining
‘processes=1’ will be that WSGI environment attribute called
‘wsgi.multiprocess’ will be set to be True when the ‘processes’ option
is defined, whereas not providing the option at all will result in the
attribute being set to be False. This distinction is to allow for where
some form of mapping mechanism might be used to distribute requests across
multiple process groups and thus in effect it is still a multiprocess
application.</p>
<p>In other words, if you use the configuration:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">WSGIDaemonProcess</span> <span class="n">example</span> <span class="n">processes</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="n">threads</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">25</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>the WSGI environment key/value pairs indicating how processes and threads
are being used will instead be:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><em>wsgi.multithread</em></dt>
<dd>True</dd>
<dt><em>wsgi.multiprocess</em></dt>
<dd>True</dd>
</dl>
<p>If you need to ensure that ‘wsgi.multiprocess’ is False so that interactive
debuggers do not complain about an incompatible configuration, simply do
not specify the ‘processes’ option and allow the default behaviour of a
single daemon process to apply.</p>
<p>To emulate the same process/thread model as the ‘worker’ MPM, that is,
multiple processes with multiple threads, the following configuration would
be used:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">WSGIDaemonProcess</span> <span class="n">example</span> <span class="n">processes</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">2</span> <span class="n">threads</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">25</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The WSGI environment key/value pairs indicating how processes and threads
are being used will for this configuration be as follows.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><em>wsgi.multithread</em></dt>
<dd>True</dd>
<dt><em>wsgi.multiprocess</em></dt>
<dd>True</dd>
</dl>
<p>To emulate the same process/thread model as the ‘prefork’ MPM, that is,
multiple processes with only a single thread running in each, the following
configuration would be used:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">WSGIDaemonProcess</span> <span class="n">example</span> <span class="n">processes</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">5</span> <span class="n">threads</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">1</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The WSGI environment key/value pairs indicating how processes and threads
are being used will for this configuration be as follows.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><em>wsgi.multithread</em></dt>
<dd>False</dd>
<dt><em>wsgi.multiprocess</em></dt>
<dd>True</dd>
</dl>
<p>Note that when using mod_wsgi daemon processes, the processes are only used
to execute the Python based WSGI application. The processes are not in any
way used to serve static files, or host applications implemented in other
languages.</p>
<p>Unlike the normal Apache child processes when ‘embedded’ mode of mod_wsgi
is used, the configuration as to the number of daemon processes within a
process group is fixed. That is, when the server experiences additional
load, no more daemon processes are created than what is defined. You should
therefore always plan ahead and make sure the number of processes and
threads defined is adequate to cope with the expected load.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sharing-of-global-data">
<h2>Sharing Of Global Data<a class="headerlink" href="#sharing-of-global-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When the ‘winnt’ MPM is being used, or the ‘prefork’ or ‘worker’ MPM are
forced to run with only a single process, all request handlers within a
specific WSGI application will always be accessing the same global data.
This global data will persist in memory until Apache is shutdown or
restarted, or in the case of the ‘prefork’ or ‘worker’ MPM until the child
process is recycled due to reaching a predefined request limit.</p>
<p>This ability to access the same global data and for that data to persist
for the lifetime of the child process is not present when either of the
‘prefork’ or ‘worker’ MPM are used in multiprocess mode. In other words,
where the WSGI environment key/value pair indicating how processes are used
is set to:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><em>wsgi.multiprocess</em></dt>
<dd>True</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is because request handlers can execute within the context of distinct
child processes, each with their own set of global data unique to that
child process.</p>
<p>The consequences of this are that you cannot assume that separate
invocations of a request handler will have access to the same global data
if that data only resides within the memory of the child process. If some
set of global data must be accessible by all invocations of a handler, that
data will need to be stored in a way that it can be accessed from multiple
child processes. Such sharing could be achieved by storing the global data
within an external database, the filesystem or in shared memory accessible
by all child processes.</p>
<p>Since the global data will be accessible from multiple child processes at
the same time, there must be adequate locking mechanisms in place to
prevent distinct child processes from trying to modify the same data at the
same time. The locking mechanisms need to also be able to deal with the
case of multiple threads within one child process accessing the global data
at the same time, as will be the case for the ‘worker’ and ‘winnt’ MPM.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="python-sub-interpreters">
<h2>Python Sub Interpreters<a class="headerlink" href="#python-sub-interpreters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The default behaviour of mod_wsgi is to create a distinct Python sub
interpreter for each WSGI application. Thus, where Apache is being used to
host multiple WSGI applications a process will contain multiple sub
interpreters. When Apache is run in a mode whereby there are multiple child
processes, each child process will contain sub interpreters for each WSGI
application.</p>
<p>When a sub interpreter is created for a WSGI application, it would then
normally persist for the life of the process. The only exception to this
would be where interpreter reloading is enabled, in which case the sub
interpreter would be destroyed and recreated when the WSGI application
script file has been changed.</p>
<p>For the sub interpreter created for each WSGI application, they will each
have their own set of Python modules. In other words, a change to the
global data within the context of one sub interpreter will not be seen from
the sub interpreter corresponding to a different WSGI application. This
will be the case whether or not the sub interpreters are in the same
process.</p>
<p>This behaviour can be modified and multiple applications grouped together
using the WSGIApplicationGroup directive. Specifically, the directive
indicates that the marked WSGI applications should be run within the
context of a common sub interpreter rather than being run in their own sub
interpreters. By doing this, each WSGI application will then have access
to the same global data. Do note though that this doesn’t change the fact
that global data will not be shared between processes.</p>
<p>The only other way of sharing data between sub interpreters within the one
child process would be to use an external data store, or a third party
C extension module for Python which allows communication or sharing of
data between multiple interpreters within the same process.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="building-a-portable-application">
<h2>Building A Portable Application<a class="headerlink" href="#building-a-portable-application" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Taking into consideration the different process models used by Apache and the
manner in which interpreters are used by mod_wsgi, to build a portable and
robust application requires the following therefore be satisified.</p>
<p>1. Where shared data needs to be visible to all application instances,
regardless of which child process they execute in, and changes made to the
data by one application are immediately available to another, including any
executing in another child process, an external data store such as a
database or shared memory must be used. Global variables in normal Python
modules cannot be used for this purpose.</p>
<p>2. Access to and modification of shared data in an external data store must
be protected so as to prevent multiple threads in the same or different
processes from interfering with each other. This would normally be achieved
through a locking mechanism visible to all child processes.</p>
<p>3. An application must be re-entrant, or simply put, be able to be called
concurrently by multiple threads at the same time. Data which needs to
exist for the life of the request, would need to be stored as stack based
data, thread local data, or cached in the WSGI application environment.
Global variables within the actual application module cannot be used for
this purpose.</p>
<p>4. Where global data in a module local to a child process is still used,
for example as a cache, access to and modification of the global data must
be protected by local thread locking mechanisms.</p>
