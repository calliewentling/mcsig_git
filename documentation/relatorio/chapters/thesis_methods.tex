\subsection{Study area: Lisbon, Portugal}
Lisbon is the capital city of Portugal, located close in the central west area of the continental country, just North of the River Tejo. Half a million people reside within the municipality of Lisbon, a total of 2.9 million in the Área Metropolitano de Lisboa (a Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics NUTS II region \cite{eurostat} of 17 municipalities both north and south of the River Tejo), and 2.3 million in the overlapping Distrito de Lisboa (16 municipalities, entirely North of the river) \cite{censos2021}.

Within the lisbon area, a variety of organizations serve communication media to the population, including such commercial endeavors as Público, Diário de Notícias, Jornal de Notícias, Observador, and at least ten other major news sources. Many of these have at least partially transitioned to an online presence, with some availabe exlusively online. A Mensagem, for example, is a newer addition to the news scene in Lisbon, is available exclusively online with some stories in the audio podcast format. This particular source is specifically aimed at hyperlocal information for the Lisbon community. Additionally, the Câmara Municipal de Lisboa solicits regular boletins and notícias, as do many of the juntas de freguesias within the municipality and beyond. News is heavily embedded in the culture, with many cafes and restaurants often streaming news channels and printed media available at kiosks at corners throughout the area. There is also a history of pirate radio in Portugal which contributed to the decentralization of speech\cite{Bonixe2019}. %-Independent Radio {“The end of the 70s marked the appearance of several pirate radios in Portugal beginning a process that would lead to the liberalization of the radio sector at the end of the following decade. For eleven years, several hundred small radios have broad-casted without a license bringing the voices of local people.”\cite{Bonixe2019}}; {“Os principais impulsionadores do fenómeno da radiodifusão local portuguesa referiam frequentemente a importância da existência de um discurso descentralizado e da partilha do processo de decisão sobre a coisa pública.” The main catalysts of the local portuguese pirate radios frequently refer to the importance of the existence of decentralized speech and the sharing of the public decision making process.\cite{Bonixe2019}};
Portugal more generally also has taken an interest in innovative journalism; João Palmeiro, president fo the Portuguese Publishers Association, chairs Google's Digital News Innovation Fund (DNI Fund), for quality journalism in Europe, which both supports portuguese media projects and includes commercial and academic Portuguese partners \cite{DNIFund2018}. %  DNI Fund {\color{orange}Portugal has taken an interest in innovative journalism: João Palmeiro (president of the Portuguese Publishers Association) chairs the DNI Fund, which both supports portuguese projects (Alberto Pereira, Cofina Media, Empresa jornalistica, região de leiria, global notícias, global notícias publicações, impresa, impresa publishing, INESC TEC, João Antunes, Agência de Notícias de Portugal [LUSA]) and includes Portuguese partners (Platforma de media privados, Público, Público: communicação social, Ricardo Lafuente, Universiety of Porto, and Visapress). \cite{DNIFund2018}}\\

The hilly and water-lined layout of the city lends rich and distinct character to neighborhoods throughout the metropolitan area. Some of these cultures have persisted through decades, like the areas of Alfama and Alvalade, while others are constantly forging new identities and even rebranding themselves to invite new stories to be told, such as the Martim Moniz and Marvila areas. This, then, makes Lisbon an interesting case study to test a spatial news visualization, to see if the heterogenous personalities will be reflected in any geospatial patterns.




%\subsubsection{Views}
%The following views describe a variety of products that stem from the same geodatabase, though can be implemented indepenently and illustrate the initial opportunities of a such an online geospatial tool.
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item A spatial database of incidents that supports the association of spatial, temporal, and thematic attributes. See Appendix \ref{appendix:organization}/Figure \ref{fig:data_model}: data model.
%	\item A POC Input tool for publishers that allows users to define the place(s) (drawing georeferrenced polygons on a map) as well as time of occurrence of incidents. It shall also, of course, preserve or potentially improve upon the association of traditional thematic attributes and keyword search. See Appendix \ref{appendix:organization}/Figure \ref{fig:input_ui}: \textit{Input} layout.
%	\item A POC Context map (visualization of an incident on a local map) for integration into each article page. See Appendix \ref{appendix:organization}/Figure \ref{fig:context_ui}: \textit{Context} layout.
%	\item A POC Search tool for researchers that allows users to filter by spatial (one or multiple defined places or via drawn definition of the study area), temporal, and or thematic attributes. The results should be displayable via both map and list views, as well as support CSV export functionality. See Appendix \ref{appendix:organization}/Figure \ref{fig:search_ui}: \textit{Search} layout.
%	\item A POC Dashboard tool for monitors (publisher, city officials, etc.) to monitor the spatial/temporal development of incidents according to their settings. 
%\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Requirements}
%\textit{See Appendix \ref{appendix:organization}}\\
%-{\color{orange}Limit classification complexity. \cite{Jiang2020}}\\

The Apregoar system architecture reflects the needs of the browsers, researchers, monitors, and publishers anticipated to use the various functions of the tool, as per the earlier description and the following specifications:

\begin{itemize}
	\item{} The system should support all create read update and delete (CRUD) operations, though most views will only require reading of selected database records. This should include text, date, and spatial types.
	\item{} The system should be implemented with no or low cost maintenance.
	\item{} The system should support open source applictions, and therefore utilize openly licenced tools as much as possible.
	\item{} The system targets non-professional GIS users, and therefore should be straightforward and easy to use.
	\item{} The system will use spatial, thematic, and temporal filtering, and will therefore leverage dataframes that can support this type of rapid processing. Likewise, definition of such filters in an easily understood format are necessary.
	\item{} Users should be able to define polygons. This is applicable both in the georeferencing of incidents, which will therefore saved as a or multiple polygon type records, as well as for defining spatial search areas for use in filtering georeferenced articles.
	\item{} The main search results will be in map and list formats. Therefore, the system must support this type of data viewing.
	
\end{itemize}
\subsection{System architecture}
The Apregoar platform components were selected based on the above requirements, as well as the functionality described in the previous section. Also considered were the functionality of potential tool, available official and community resources, as well as prior experience in the options.

An event model requires spatiotemporal and attribute elements, with the former requriing specific formats and processing for data manipulation and storage. For this reason, the data storage leverages PostgreSQL with a Postgis extension for its vector data storage capabilities, support in literature (\cite{Oliveira2021,Bhattacharya2018,Teitler2008,Sami2019}), support for remote connection via python using related packages, and personal experience with the platform.

For mapping visualization in the front, Open Layer and Map Box were both considered. Open Layers better adheres to open source standards, though to streamline the proof-of-concept development phase, MapBox was implemented due to its prior experience, as well as integration of a variety of functionality via its javascript library that supports many of the operational, yet not focal, functionality of this project.

\subsection{Relational data model}
The data relates potentially multiple spatial definitions to a particular news story via the association with instances, which layer back in the temporal element of each story. Users are also defined such that published articles can be edited by those who created those records, and then associated with activity of that user (or set of affiliated users, if applicable). This relationship is outlined in Figure \ref{fig:data_model}.

	\caption{Data model}
	\label{fig:data_model}
\end{figure}

Publishers can associate spatiotemporal and thematic attributes to the stories they publish, reference to which is stored in a geodatabase. Only publishers perform any sort of data manipulation (create, update, delete) operations, while the remaining views simply read the data stored within. 

\subsection{Data Collection}
\subsubsection{Corpora}
The following corpora is selected as a representation of event reports for the month of October, 2020. It incorporates public organization (Municipality and selected Freguesias) as well as private newsmedia sources to inform the organiational rubric and data model.

All attributes are copied direclty from the source materials, with the exeption of times and places. These are extracted from the corpora, as these elements may not be explicitys stated (``yesterday'' or ``near the road'' or ``on his birthday''). Required fields indicate those that must be extractable from articles to be included in the corpora. Priority fields are ideally included, and efforts to extract this data will be made if not immediately obvious. If not applicable, these fields may remain blank. Other fields are helpful but not critical for inclusion.
