This project seeks to develop a proof-of-concept (POC) open source (OS) and free software (FS) web application (Web App) that supports the visualization of the spatial distribution of news story contents (“incidents”), as well as filtering mechanisms for improved temporal, spatial, and thematic investigation of news articles. This geospatial element is expected to provide an additional dimension of understanding that allows users to better contextualize news stories, search repositories, or monitor spatial/temporal trends at a community level (within a city). In addition to the aforementioned improvements of user experience for the public (readers, researchers, and monitors), it is also expected to support publishers via the inference of new insights from their existing internal data, such as the illumination of under- or over-reporting of areas by theme for better investigative coverage. Ideally, this functionality could be expanded to integrate multiple sources, as well as the incorporation of planned events and/or resources to provide a more comprehensive understanding of one's surroundings in both the planned future and transpired past.
