We used translocation experiments to establish foraging distances and measured foraging trip duration t9 analyse how solitary bees cope with the distance between nesting sites and suitable food plants in different habitat types. 2. Maximum foraging distance between nesting site and food patch was 150-600 m for the 16 bee species examined. Foraging distance was correlated positively with body length. Mean foraging trip duration, measured for seven bee species, ranged from 6 to 28 min and was also correlated with body length. In a study of the polylectic species Osmia rufa, we found a significant decrease in foraging trip duration with increasing number of plant species. Logistic regressions showed that the oligolectic Megachile lapponica nested in trap nests with a probability of 50% if the distance between trap nest and food patch was less than 250 m. The oligolectic Chelostoma rapunculi utilized trap nests when the distance to the nearest food patch was less than 300 m. 3. These experiments showed that solitary bees have a rather small foraging range so local habitat structure appears to be of more importance than large-scale landscape structure. All requirements for sustaining viable populations must be within this range. Therefore, it is necessary to maintain and restore a dense network of habitat patches in landscapes to ensure long-term sustainability of wild bee diversity and their ecological function as pollinators.},

   abstract = {Pollination is a key ecosystem service as many crops but in particular, fruits and vegetables are partially dependent on pollinating insects to produce food for human consumption. Here we assessed how pollination services are delivered at the European scale. We used this assessment to estimate the relative contribution of wild pollinators to crop production. We developed an index of relative pollination potential, which is defined as the relative potential or relative capacity of ecosystems to support crop pollination. The model for relative pollination potential is based on the assumption that different habitats, but in particular forest edges, grasslands rich in flowers and riparian areas, offer suitable sites for wild pollinator insects. Using data of the foraging range of wild bees with short flight distances, we linked relative pollination potential to regional statistics of crop production. At aggregated EU level, the absence of insect pollination would result in a reduction of between 25% and 32% of the total production of crops which are partially dependent on insect pollination, depending on the data source used for the assessment. This production deficit decreases to 2.5% if only the relative pollination potential of a single guild of pollinators is considered. A strength of our approach is the spatially-explicit link between land cover based relative pollination potential and crop yield which enables a general assessment of the benefits that are derived from pollination services in Europe while providing insight where pollination gaps in the landscape occur.},

   abstract = {Value estimates of ecosystem goods and services are useful to justify the allocation of resources towards conservation, but inconclusive estimates risk unsustainable resource allocations. Here we present replacement costs as a more accurate value estimate of insect pollination as an ecosystem service, although this method could also be applied to other services. The importance of insect pollination to agriculture is unequivocal. However, whether this service is largely provided by wild pollinators (genuine ecosystem service) or managed pollinators (commercial service), and which of these requires immediate action amidst reports of pollinator decline, remains contested. If crop pollination is used to argue for biodiversity conservation, clear distinction should be made between values of managed- and wild pollination services. Current methods either under-estimate or over-estimate the pollination service value, and make use of criticised general insect and managed pollinator dependence factors. We apply the theoretical concept of ascribing a value to a service by calculating the cost to replace it, as a novel way of valuing wild and managed pollination services. Adjusted insect and managed pollinator dependence factors were used to estimate the cost of replacing insect- and managed pollination services for the Western Cape deciduous fruit industry of South Africa. Using pollen dusting and hand pollination as suitable replacements, we value pollination services significantly higher than current market prices for commercial pollination, although lower than traditional proportional estimates. The complexity associated with inclusive value estimation of pollination services required several defendable assumptions, but made estimates more inclusive than previous attempts. Consequently this study provides the basis for continued improvement in context specific pollination service value estimates. © 2008 Allsopp et al.},

Indeed, adequate pollination services can increase the production and quality of fruit and vegetable crops. This service is currently challenged by land use intensification and expanding human population growth. Hence, this study aims: (1) to assess the pollination services in different land uses with different levels of disturbance through GIS mapping technique using insect pollinators abundance and richness as indicators, and (2) estimate the economic value of pollination by insects in agricultural crops. Our study takes place in a small oceanic island, Terceira (Azores, Portugal). Our results showed, remarkably, that not only the pristine vegetation areas, but also the orchards and agricultural areas have relatively high values of pollination services, even though both land uses have opposite disturbance levels. For the economic valuation, we analyzed 24 crops in the island and found that 18 depend on pollinators with one-third of these crops having 65% or 95% dependence on pollinators. The economic contribution of pollinators totals 36.2% of the total mean annual agricultural income of the dependent crops, highlighting the importance of insect pollinators in agricultural production and consequent economic gain productions.},

   abstract = {Context: Landscape metrics represent powerful tools for quantifying landscape structure, but uncertainties persist around their interpretation. Urban settings add unique considerations, containing habitat structures driven by the surrounding built-up environment. Understanding urban ecosystems, however, should focus on the habitats rather than the matrix. Objectives: We coupled a multivariate approach with landscape metric analysis to overcome existing shortcomings in interpretation. We then explored relationships between landscape characteristics and modelled ecosystem service provision. Methods: We used principal component analysis and cluster analysis to isolate the most effective measures of landscape variability and then grouped habitat patches according to their attributes, independent of the surrounding urban form. We compared results to the modelled provision of three ecosystem services. Seven classes resulting from cluster analysis were separated primarily on patch area, and secondarily by measures of shape complexity and inter-patch distance. Results: When compared to modelled ecosystem services, larger patches up to 10 ha in size consistently stored more carbon per area and supported more pollinators, while exhibiting a greater risk of soil erosion. Smaller, isolated patches showed the opposite, and patches larger than 10 ha exhibited no additional areal benefit. Conclusions: Multivariate landscape metric analysis offers greater confidence and consistency than analysing landscape metrics individually. Independent classification avoids the influence of the urban matrix surrounding habitats of interest, and allows patches to be grouped according to their own attributes. Such a grouping is useful as it may correlate more strongly with the characteristics of landscape structure that directly affect ecosystem function.},

   abstract = {Context: Urbanisation places increasing stress on ecosystem services; however existing methods and data for testing relationships between service delivery and urban landscapes remain imprecise and uncertain. Unknown impacts of scale are among several factors that complicate research. This study models ecosystem services in the urban area comprising the towns of Milton Keynes, Bedford and Luton which together represent a wide range of the urban forms present in the UK. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to test (1) the sensitivity of ecosystem service model outputs to the spatial resolution of input data, and (2) whether any resultant scale dependency is constant across different ecosystem services and model approaches (e.g. stock- versus flow-based). Methods: Carbon storage, sediment erosion, and pollination were modelled with the InVEST framework using input data representative of common coarse (25 m) and fine (5 m) spatial resolutions. Results: Fine scale analysis generated higher estimates of total carbon storage (9.32 vs. 7.17 kg m−2) and much lower potential sediment erosion estimates (6.4 vs. 18.1 Mg km−2 year−1) than analyses conducted at coarser resolutions; however coarse-scale analysis estimated more abundant pollination service provision. Conclusions: Scale sensitivities depend on the type of service being modelled; stock estimates (e.g. carbon storage) are most sensitive to aggregation across scales, dynamic flow models (e.g. sediment erosion) are most sensitive to spatial resolution, and ecological process models involving both stocks and dynamics (e.g. pollination) are sensitive to both.

During the past decades, urban residential development has speed up extremely with massive population mobility in cities. The purpose of this study is to propose an integrated approach for sustainability assessment of urban residential development, considering sustainability indicators, housing equilibrium and building visualization. Firstly based on merging DPSIR (Driving Forces, Pressure, State, Impact and Response) framework and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), the indicators were systematized for the sustainability modeling. Due to the urban activities cause impacts not only on local level but also a broader scale, a simulation model, using System Dynamics (SD) methodology, was structured to quantitatively investigate the developmental tendency of the indicators. And then the estimated results were displayed in 2D density maps in ArcGIS and 3D visualization in CityEngine. A real case study was presented for the Stuttgart Region of the state of Baden-Württemberg in Southern Germany and its Plieningen district to experience the usefulness and feasibility of the developed approach. The integration of GIS, SD model and 3D visualization, called GISSD system here, can better explain the interaction and the variation of the sustainability indicators for residential development. Hence it is able to support the Decision Maker to view the sustainable level of urban residential areas more comprehensively. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

A variety of social, political, and environmental factors contribute to the model's predictor variables of land use change. This paper presents a version of the LTM parameterized for Michigan's Grand Traverse Bay Watershed and explores how factors such as roads, high-ways, residential streets, rivers, Great Lakes coastlines, recreational facilities, inland lakes, agricultural density, and quality of views can influence urbanization patterns in this coastal watershed. ANNs are used to learn the patterns of development in the region and test the predictive capacity of the model, while GIS is used to develop the spatial, predictor drivers and perform spatial analysis on the results. The predictive ability of the model improved at larger scales when assessed using a moving scalable window metric. Finally, the individual contribution of each predictor variable was examined and shown to vary across spatial scales. At the smallest scales, quality views were the strongest predictor variable. We interpreted the multi-scale influences of land use change, illustrating the relative influences of site (e.g. quality of views, residential streets) and situation (e.g. highways and county roads) variables at different scales. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

   abstract = {The agricultural expansion and intensification required to meet growing food and agri-based product demand present important challenges to future levels and management of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Influential actors such as corporations, governments, and multilateral organizations have made commitments to meeting future agricultural demand sustainably and preserving critical ecosystems. Current approaches to predicting the impacts of agricultural expansion involve calculation of total land conversion and assessment of the impacts on biodiversity or ecosystem services on a per-area basis, generally assuming a linear relationship between impact and land area. However, the impacts of continuing land development are often not linear and can vary considerably with spatial configuration. We demonstrate what could be gained by spatially explicit analysis of agricultural expansion at a large scale compared with the simple measure of total area converted, with a focus on the impacts on biodiversity and carbon storage. Using simple modeling approaches for two regions of Brazil, we find that for the same amount of land conversion, the declines in biodiversity and carbon storage can vary two- to fourfold depending on the spatial pattern of conversion. Impacts increase most rapidly in the earliest stages of agricultural expansion and are more pronounced in scenarios where conversion occurs in forest interiors compared with expansion into forests from their edges. This study reveals the importance of spatially explicit information in the assessment of land-use change impacts and for future land management and conservation.},

   abstract = {Many ecosystem services are delivered by organisms that depend on habitats that are segregated spatially or temporally from the location where services are provided. Management of mobile organisms contributing to ecosystem services requires consideration not only of the local scale where services are delivered, but also the distribution of resources at the landscape scale, and the foraging ranges and dispersal movements of the mobile agents. We develop a conceptual model for exploring how one such mobile-agent-based ecosystem service (MABES), pollination, is affected by land-use change, and then generalize the model to other MABES. The model includes interactions and feedbacks among policies affecting land use, market forces and the biology of the organisms involved. Animal-mediated pollination contributes to the production of goods of value to humans such as crops; it also bolsters reproduction of wild plants on which other services or service-providing organisms depend. About one-third of crop production depends on animal pollinators, while 60-90% of plant species require an animal pollinator. The sensitivity of mobile organisms to ecological factors that operate across spatial scales makes the services provided by a given community of mobile agents highly contextual. Services vary, depending on the spatial and temporal distribution of resources surrounding the site, and on biotic interactions occurring locally, such as competition among pollinators for resources, and among plants for pollinators. The value of the resulting goods or services may feed back via market-based forces to influence land-use policies, which in turn influence land management practices that alter local habitat conditions and landscape structure. Developing conceptual models for MABES aids in identifying knowledge gaps, determining research priorities, and targeting interventions that can be applied in an adaptive management context. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

   abstract = {The extent of our reliance on animal pollination for world crop production for human food has not previously been evaluated and the previous estimates for countries or continents have seldom used primary data. In this review, we expand the previous estimates using novel primary data from 200 countries and found that fruit, vegetable or seed production from 87 of the leading global food crops is dependent upon animal pollination, while 28 crops do not rely upon animal pollination. However, global production volumes give a contrasting perspective, since 60% of global production comes from crops that do not depend on animal pollination, 35% from crops that depend on pollinators, and 5% are unevaluated. Using all crops traded on the world market and setting aside crops that are solely passively self-pollinated, wind-pollinated or parthenocarpic, we then evaluated the level of dependence on animal-mediated pollination for crops that are directly consumed by humans. We found that pollinators are essential for 13 crops, production is highly pollinator dependent for 30, moderately for 27, slightly for 21, unimportant for 7, and is of unknown significance for the remaining 9. We further evaluated whether local and landscape-wide management for natural pollination services could help to sustain crop diversity and production.

   abstract = {The Knowledge Innovation Project on an Integrated system of Natural Capital and ecosystem services Accounting (KIP INCA) aims to develop a set of experimental accounts at the EU level, following the United Nations System of Environmental-Economic Accounting- Experimental Ecosystem Accounts (SEEA-EEA). The application of the SEEA- EEA framework is useful to illustrate ecosystem accounts with clear examples, to further develop the methodology outlined in the Technical Recommendations, and to give guidance for Natural Capital Accounting. This report assesses and accounts for two ecosystem services: outdoor recreation (on a daily basis) and crop pollination. Each service is assessed biophysically using the ESTIMAP toolbox, allowing us to quantify different service components: the service potential that ecosystems can deliver; the demand for each service; and the actual flow of the service, which is used by people based on the spatial relationship between the service potential and the demand. The results of the biophysical assessment are then translated into monetary units using valuation methods consistent with the System of National Accounts. Valuation methods require the integration of the key variables of the biophysical model to quantify the actual service flow. This way, changes in the value of the service are strictly linked to changes in biophysical assessment, which includes potential, demand and their spatial relationship determining the actual flow. Accounting of outdoor recreation focuses on locations offering high opportunities for outdoor recreation that are close to urban areas and roads, being therefore, suitable for a daily use. Outdoor recreation accounts show that at the EU level, forest ecosystems have the highest contribution to the outdoor recreation flow, although this varies across countries. Households are the users of the service, with Germany being the country with the largest share of population whose demand for daily recreation is sufficiently covered. Countries with a larger share of population living within 4 km of the areas for daily recreation considered for the accounting present a higher level of satisfaction with recreational and green spaces. The accounts show an overall increase in the use of the service between 2000 and 2012 (26%), mainly due to the enhancement of the recreation potential, and, to a lesser extent, to an increase in the demand (population). These results are useful to support policy decisions related to land planning, aiming at guaranteeing equitable access to outdoor recreation opportunities (citizen rights): 38% of the population at the EU has limited access to recreational areas (unmet demand). We estimated for 2012 an actual flow of 40 million potential visits to recreational areas per year, with a conservative total annual value of 50 billion euro. Crop pollination accounts in 2006 show that 13 million tonne of food production in the EU is derived from crop pollination, which represents 15% of the total yield of pollinator- dependent crops. The value of crop pollination as ecosystem service is 3 billion euro. Fresh fruits show the largest value of the actual flow (2.1 billion euro in 2006). There is an overall increase in the actual flow of the service, mainly due to the increase in pollinator-dependent crops. Crop pollination assessment and accounts provides useful results to support prioritization of Green Infrastructure deployment and, importantly, the EU Pollinators Initiative. The work presented in this report highlights the importance of the spatial relationship between ecosystem service potential and demand. The changes in the use of the service cannot be explained solely by changes in the potential and demand, but also by their spatial relationship. When dealing with ecosystem services the spatial component is a key driver that needs to be integrated within the accounting framework for a consistent assessment. The spatial relationship between potential and demand is different for each service. Crop pollination requires the spatial overlap between potential and demand, whereas proximity is the key spatial feature for outdoor recreation. As shown by the two examples, ecosystem service accounts significantly differ depending on the service being assessed, both conceptually and methodologically. Hence, further examples of ecosystem service accounting are needed to produce accounting tables for a representative number of service. Ultimately, the availability of this information represents a key input for the analysis of synergies and trade-offs between ecosystem services.},

   abstract = {Bees provide essential pollination services that are potentially affected both by local farm management and the surrounding landscape. To better understand these different factors, we modelled the relative effects of landscape composition (nesting and floral resources within foraging distances), landscape configuration (patch shape, interpatch connectivity and habitat aggregation) and farm management (organic vs. conventional and local-scale field diversity), and their interactions, on wild bee abundance and richness for 39 crop systems globally. Bee abundance and richness were higher in diversified and organic fields and in landscapes comprising more high-quality habitats; bee richness on conventional fields with low diversity benefited most from high-quality surrounding land cover. Landscape configuration effects were weak. Bee responses varied slightly by biome. Our synthesis reveals that pollinator persistence will depend on both the maintenance of high-quality habitats around farms and on local management practices that may offset impacts of intensive monoculture agriculture. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

We applied the InVEST Crop Pollination model, developed to predict native bee abundance from habitat resources, in Maine's wild blueberry crop landscape. We evaluated model performance with parameters informed by four approaches: 1) expert opinion; 2) sensitivity analysis; 3) sensitivity analysis informed model optimization; and, 4) simulated annealing (uninformed) model optimization. Uninformed optimization improved model performance by 29% compared to expert opinion-informed model, while sensitivity-analysis informed optimization improved model performance by 54%. This suggests that expert opinion may not result in the best parameter values for the InVEST model. The proportion of deciduous/mixed forest within 2000 m of a blueberry field also reliably predicted native bee abundance in blueberry fields, however, the InVEST model provides an efficient tool to estimate bee abundance beyond the field perimeter.},

   abstract = {Insect pollination is important for food production globally and apples are one of the major fruit crops which are reliant on this ecosystem service. It is fundamentally important that the full range of benefits of insect pollination to crop production are understood, if the costs of interventions aiming to enhance pollination are to be compared against the costs of the interventions themselves. Most previous studies have simply assessed the benefits of pollination to crop yield and ignored quality benefits and how these translate through to economic values. In the present study we examine the influence of insect pollination services on farmgate output of two important UK apple varieties; Gala and Cox. Using field experiments, we quantify the influence of insect pollination on yield and importantly quality and whether either may be limited by sub-optimal insect pollination. Using an expanded bioeconomic model we value insect pollination to UK apple production and establish the potential for improvement through pollination service management. We show that insects are essential in the production of both varieties of apple in the UK and contribute a total of £36.7 million per annum, over £6 million more than the value calculated using more conventional dependence ratio methods. Insect pollination not only affects the quantity of production but can also have marked impacts on the quality of apples, influencing size, shape and effecting their classification for market. These effects are variety specific however. Due to the influence of pollination on both yield and quality in Gala, there is potential for insect pollination services to improve UK output by up to £5.7 million per annum. Our research shows that continued pollinator decline could have serious financial implications for the apple industry but there is considerable scope through management of wild pollinators or using managed pollinator augmentation, to improve the quality of production. Furthermore, we show that it is critically important to consider all production parameters including quality, varietal differences and management costs when valuing the pollination service of any crop so investment in pollinator management can be proportional to its contribution. © 2013 The Authors.},

   abstract = {1. Habitat requirements of solitary bees include nesting sites, food resources and nesting material. We used translocation experiments to establish foraging distances and measured foraging trip duration t9 analyse how solitary bees cope with the distance between nesting sites and suitable food plants in different habitat types. 2. Maximum foraging distance between nesting site and food patch was 150-600 m for the 16 bee species examined. Foraging distance was correlated positively with body length. Mean foraging trip duration, measured for seven bee species, ranged from 6 to 28 min and was also correlated with body length. In a study of the polylectic species Osmia rufa, we found a significant decrease in foraging trip duration with increasing number of plant species. Logistic regressions showed that the oligolectic Megachile lapponica nested in trap nests with a probability of 50% if the distance between trap nest and food patch was less than 250 m. The oligolectic Chelostoma rapunculi utilized trap nests when the distance to the nearest food patch was less than 300 m. 3. These experiments showed that solitary bees have a rather small foraging range so local habitat structure appears to be of more importance than large-scale landscape structure. All requirements for sustaining viable populations must be within this range. Therefore, it is necessary to maintain and restore a dense network of habitat patches in landscapes to ensure long-term sustainability of wild bee diversity and their ecological function as pollinators.},

This context introduces the importance of quantifying the impacts resulting from land artificialization increase, the assessment of coastal erosion and the development of strategies for achieving an Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM). In this study we employed the Land Transformation Model (LTM) to forecast urban growth to year 2014 in the South Coast of São Miguel Island, Azores (Portugal). Two different scenarios formodeling urban growth were tested: (1) one that considered an urban sprawl trend equivalent to the one measured between years 1998 and 2005, and (2) another that considered the restrictions included in the intervention area of South Coast Management Plan (POOC Costa Sul). The objective was to evaluate the impact of the POOC Costa Sul in the urban growth of the studied area. Results show that the POOC Costa Sul is not effective in containing urban growth quantities which are equivalent to the non-restricted scenario. However, it was possible to observe that it is effective in deciding where the urban expansion is likely to happen, preventing, for instances, the occurrence of urban growth near water lines or in the maritime public domain. We conclude that this type of models can be very relevant to manage and monitor coastal management plans. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013.},

   abstract = {Pollinators, especially bees, are essential to terrestrial ecosystems. They ensure the maintenance of certain ecological processes, like superior plants' reproduction. In the past decades, agricultural intensification has caused extensive environmental changes, with major impacts on biodiversity, especially on the pollinators, which reflects the loss of fruits and seeds sets. Here, we review studies that elucidate the causes of decline of pollinators, consequences of landscape changes to agriculture and possibilities to bees' conservation. Many studies have related the loss of pollinators to changes in the landscape, such as the conversion of native forests into cultivated areas, which causes loss of important elements for bees (e.g., sources of pollen, nectar and oil, as well as varied nesting sites). Studies involving landscape ecology allow us to assess the effects of different farming practices over the richness and abundance of pollinators. Among the landscape elements performing positive influence on bees, the presence of remaining forests nearby cultivated areas proved to be a very important factor. Nevertheless, studies that evaluate all ground cover with a more integrated approach are still required to assess the effects of landscape context on the diversity and on the abundance of bees related to productivity of crops. Researches like these could provide specific data that strengthen the need for the conservation of different plants and animals, and could offer subsidies to propose necessary information for the execution of public and private policies, aimed at the conservation of the biodiversity. ©2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

We used data from 96 records of 62 bee species to determine whether body size predicts foraging distance. We regressed maximum and typical foraging distances on body size and found highly significant and explanatory nonlinear relationships. We used a second data set to: (1) compare observed reports of foraging distance to the distances predicted by our regression equations and (2) assess the biases inherent to the different techniques that have been used to assess foraging distance. The equations we present can be used to predict foraging distances for many bee species, based on a simple measurement of body size. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

The results of the EI are supported by the Desinventar Database, which has historic data concerning loss and damage caused by events of geological or weather related origin. These results also indicate where the most exposed areas are thereby providing useful information to design effective coastal plans that increase resilience to climate hazards and erosion in Mozambique.},

   abstract = {Riverine landscapes provide numerous ecosystem services, of which pollination is essential to increase the yield, quality, and stability of crops and the biodiversity of wild flora. Pollinators’ behaviour and their community dynamics are often affected by the spatial distribution of floral and nesting resources at the landscape scale, and are thus sensitive to land-use land-cover (LULC) changes and management practices. The main objective of this study is to understand how changes in riparian vegetation and LULC at River Minho affect pollination services. For this, an approach based on the temporal analysis of historical cartography (1898) and current satellite imagery (2016) was used. We developed a novel Pollination Suitability Index for Riverine Landscapes (PSIRL) using LULC data as a proxy of habitat suitability for insect pollinators. PSIRL scores were derived from expert judgment of the local habitat conditions, floral diversity and field surveys. The PSIRL values obtained for both periods were compared using pairwise T-tests. We detected an overall reduction of the pollination services in the riverine landscape of River Minho from 1898 to 2016. However, at local level we observed gains and losses of pollination suitability as a result of distinct LULC changes. There was a marked decrease in the PSIRL in the most downstream and upstream riverine sections due to generalized conversion of scrublands, broadleaved-forests and heterogeneous agricultural areas to artificial surfaces and managed forests dominated by maritime pine and eucalyptus. However, in the middle section of the river, the area occupied by scrublands, riparian and broadleaved forests increased, resulting in an increase of the foraging resources for insects, and a consequent increase of the PSIRL. This index can be used to monitor and capture changes in the pollination suitability of complex riverine landscapes and support further land and river management decisions. The historical cartography proved to be a valuable source of information to characterize LULC change and hence to assess the evolutionary trajectory of pollination ecosystem services, at global and local level.},

   abstract = {Introduction: Data about the occurrence of airborne pollen enables the creation of pollen calendars with an approximation of flowering periods for the most common allergenic plant species in a specific area. The aim of this work is to provide pollen calendar for each of the seven monitoring regions of Portugal based on 15 years of airborne sampling, in order to chart the seasonal behaviour of the main allergenic pollen types. Material and methods: Airborne pollen monitoring (2002–2017) was carried out by the Portuguese Aerobiology Network (RPA), using Hirst-type volumetric spore traps, following well-established guidelines. Results: A total of 14 airborne pollen types were recorded at RPA monitoring stations, of which 64.2% belong to trees, 28.5% to herbs and 7.1% to weeds. The airborne pollen spectrum is dominated by important allergenic pollen types such as Poaceae, Quercus spp., Urticaceae and Cupressaceae. The average pollen index was 42.557 in mainland Portugal and 3.818 in the Islands. There was an increased trend in the airborne pollen levels over the years, namely in Coimbra, Évora and Porto, compared to the remaining regions. Conclusion: This report provides accessible information about the main allergenic airborne pollen types occurring in the course of the year. The pollen calendars charted for each Portuguese region showed that the occurrence of most allergenic taxa was centred from March to July. Pollen peak concentrations were detected earlier in the Centre and Lisbon and Tagus Valley regions, and later in the remaining regions.},

We restrict our focus to services provided by "wild" insects; we do not include services from domesticated or mass-reared insect species. The four insect services for which we provide value estimates - dung burial, pest control, pollination, and wildlife nutrition - were chosen not because of their importance but because of the availability of data and an algorithm for their estimation. We base our estimations of the value of each service on projections of losses that would accrue if insects were not functioning at their current level. We estimate the annual value of these ecological services provided in the United States to be at least $57 billion, an amount that justifies greater investment in the conservation of these services. © 2006 American Institute of Biological Sciences.},

   abstract = {Insect pollination benefits over three quarters of the world's major crops. There is growing concern that observed declines in pollinators may impact on production and revenues from animal pollinated crops. Knowing the distribution of pollinators is therefore crucial for estimating their availability to pollinate crops; however, in general, we have an incomplete knowledge of where these pollinators occur. We propose a method to predict geographical patterns of pollination service to crops, novel in two elements: the use of pollinator records rather than expert knowledge to predict pollinator occurrence, and the inclusion of the managed pollinator supply. We integrated a maximum entropy species distribution model (SDM) with an existing pollination service model (PSM) to derive the availability of pollinators for crop pollination. We used nation-wide records of wild and managed pollinators (honey bees) as well as agricultural data from Great Britain. We first calibrated the SDM on a representative sample of bee and hoverfly crop pollinator species, evaluating the effects of different settings on model performance and on its capacity to identify the most important predictors. The importance of the different predictors was better resolved by SDM derived from simpler functions, with consistent results for bees and hoverflies. We then used the species distributions from the calibrated model to predict pollination service of wild and managed pollinators, using field beans as a test case. The PSM allowed us to spatially characterize the contribution of wild and managed pollinators and also identify areas potentially vulnerable to low pollination service provision, which can help direct local scale interventions. This approach can be extended to investigate geographical mismatches between crop pollination demand and the availability of pollinators, resulting from environmental change or policy scenarios. © 2013 Polce et al.},

   abstract = {Insect pollinators are a key component of biodiversity; they also play a major role in the reproduction of many species of wild plants and crops. It is widely acknowledged that insect pollinators are threatened by many environmental pressures, mostly of anthropogenic nature. Their decline is a global phenomenon. A better understanding of their distribution can help their monitoring and ultimately facilitate conservation actions. Since we only have partial knowledge of where pollinator species occur, the possibility to predict suitable environmental conditions from scattered species records can facilitate not only species monitoring, but also the identification of areas potentially vulnerable to pollinators decline. This data paper contains the predicted distribution of 47 species of bumblebees across the 28 Member States of the European Union (EU-28). Amongst the wild pollinators, bumblebees are one of the major groups contributing to the production of many crop species, hence their decline in Europe, North America and Asia can potentially threaten food security. Predictions were derived from distribution models, using species records with a spatial resolution of 10 km accessed from a central repository. Predictions were based on records from 1991 to 2012 and on a series of spatial environmental predictors from three main thematic areas: land use and land cover, climate and topography. These distributions were used to estimate the value of pollination as an ecosystem service. In light of the recent European Pollinators Initiative, this paper provides valuable information for a better understanding of where wild pollinators occur and it should be extended to other pollinator species.},

   abstract = {Bee (Hymenoptera: Apoidea) pollination is an ecosystem service of the utmost importance to the living world. However, multiple anthropogenic sources allied to the strong unawareness of the diversity and habits of wild bees, have been threatening these pollinators in the last decades. The main goal of this work was to deepen the knowledge regarding wild bee diversity in Portugal, identifying their ecological characteristics in an urbanized green space (Tapada da Ajuda), located in Lisbon, by sampling five distinct sites: Almotivo’s Herbaceous plants, Terra Grande’s Community Garden, Pavilhão de Exposições’ public Garden, Citrus orchard and the Botanical Reserve. In addition, it was intended to understand how interventions at these sites can condition bee diversity from a seasonal point of view, suggesting in the end, management measures aimed at improving ecosystem services provided by pollinators in this green space. In all, 867 specimens were collected, comprising five families, 21 genera and 66 species, of which eight are considered rare in Portugal. The most frequent species were Apis mellifera L., Xylocopa violacea (L.) and Bombus terrestris L. Most of the captured species were cavity nesters, solitary and floral generalists. The Botanical Reserve presented the largest number of bee species identified (44 species), while the citrus orchard had the lowest diversity, registering only 5 species. Floral richeness was the factor that most likely influenced the number of bee species collected at these sites. In general, human intervention was beneficial to the diversity of bees in Terra Grande’s community garden, while in the public garden around Pavilhão de Exposições and in the citrus orchard it had a negative impact. It was suggested to carry out new studies, to increase floral diversity and native plant species, to create nesting structures and to raise awareness among the public in general. The data obtained showed that Tapada da Ajuda can host a great diversity of wild bees, even though it’s located in the largest urban center of the country.},

   abstract = {Wild bees are highly valuable pollinators. Along with managed honey bees, they provide a critical ecosystem service by ensuring stable pollination to agriculture and wild plant communities. Increasing concern about the welfare of both wild and managed pollinators, however, has prompted recent calls for national evaluation and action. Here, for the first time to our knowledge, we assess the status and trends ofwild bees and their potential impacts on pollination services across the coterminous United States. We use a spatial habitat model, national land-cover data, and carefully quantified expert knowledge to estimate wild bee abundance and associated uncertainty. Between 2008 and 2013, modeled bee abundance declined across 23% of US land area. This decline was generally associated with conversion of natural habitats to row crops. We identify 139 counties where low bee abundances correspond to large areas of pollinator-dependent crops. These areas of mismatch between supply (wild bee abundance) and demand (cultivated area) for pollination comprise 39% of the pollinator-dependent crop area in the United States. Further, we find that the crops most highly dependent on pollinators tend to experience more severe mismatches between declining supply and increasing demand. These trends, should they continue, may increase costs for US farmers and may even destabilize crop production over time. National assessments such as this can help focus both scientific and political efforts to understand and sustain wild bees. As new information becomes available, repeated assessments can update findings, revise priorities, and track progress toward sustainable management of our nation's pollinators.},

These cities aim to increase the quality of life for its citizens, making living in an urban space more attractive, livelier, and greener. In order to accomplish these goals, physical sensors are deployed throughout the city to oversee numerous features such as envi- ronmental parameters, traffic, and the resource consumption. However, this concept lacks the human dimension within an urban context, not reflecting how humans perceive their environment and the city’s services. In this context there is a need to consider sentiment analysis within a smart city as a key element toward coherent decision making, since it is important not only to assess what people are doing, but also, why they are behaving in a certain way. In this sense, this work aims to assemble tools and methods that can collect, analyze and share information, based on User Generated spatial Content and Open Source Geospatial Science. The emotional states of citizens were sensed through social media data sources (Twitter), by extracting features (location, user profile information and tweet content by using the Twitter Streaming API) and applying machine learning techniques, such as natural language processing (Tweepy 3.0, Python library), text analysis and computational linguis- tics (Textblob, Python library). With this approach we are capable to map abstract concepts like sentiment while linking both quantitative and qualitative analysis in human geography. This work would lead to understand and evaluate the “immaterial” and emotional dimension of the city and its spatial expression, where location-based social networks, can be established as pivotal geospatial data sources revealing the pulse of the city.},

We conducted a design study over 18 months with clinicians performing intensive diabetes management. We present a data abstraction and novel hierarchical task abstraction for this domain. We also contribute IDMVis: a visualization tool for temporal event sequences with multidimensional, interrelated data. IDMVis includes a novel technique for folding and aligning records by dual sentinel events and scaling the intermediate timeline. We validate our design decisions based on our domain abstractions, best practices, and through a qualitative evaluation with six clinicians. The results of this study indicate that IDMVis accurately reflects the workflow of clinicians. Using IDMVis, clinicians are able to identify issues of data quality such as missing or conflicting data, reconstruct patient records when data is missing, differentiate between days with different patterns, and promote educational interventions after identifying discrepancies.},

The structural issues that plague it, neither natural nor inevitable, are not hidden any longer under a veneer of plenty. As the world is desperately looking for alternatives, food is also revealed to us as a design problem. As Bill Brown points out, we ‘confront the thingness of objects when they stop working for us … when their flow within the circuits of production and distribution, consumption, and exhibition, has been arrested, however momentarily’.1 Especially today, a pervasive sense of crisis in terms of environmental sustainability, social inequality and public health emergencies confronts us with the ‘thingness’ of the food system and the dynamics that support it. We realize that these malfunctioning parts are frequently man-made, constituting badly designed failures of foresight or empathy. Together with engineers and scientists, designers have been instrumental in generating technological innovations, agricultural advancements and industrial efficiencies that have ensured food security for growing segments of the world population. So far, designers have not been in the position to revolutionize the existing supply chains and capitalist market arrangements, as partnerships with the food industry and transnational corporations have usually generated incremental adjustments rather than systemic sea changes. These dynamics raise questions about how design can foster innovation in the food system. Major transformations of strategic material infrastructures and fundamental social and economic priorities entail interventions that require design to participate in collective action and political processes, going beyond its traditional modes of operation. To what extent are designers ready to shift the terms of their practice? How are they rethinking their role?},

Sensors capture data at all scales continually so it is imperative that useful information be extracted ubiquitously and regularly. Location plays a vital part by helping understand relations between datasets. It is crucial to link developmental works with spatial attributes and current challenge is to create an open platform that manages real-time sensor data and provides critical spatial analytics atop expert domain knowledge provided in the system. That is a two-faced problem where the solution tackles not only data from multiple sources but also runs data management platform, a spatial data infrastructure(SDI) as backbone framework able to harness sensor web(SW). The paper proposes development of such a globally shared open spatial expert system(ES), SmaCiSENS, a first of a kind geo-enabled knowledge based(KB) ES for multiple fields, smarter cities to climate modeling. SmaCiSENS is integration of SW and SDI with domain KB on data and problems, ready to infer solutions. The paper describes an architecture for semantic enablement for SW, SDI; connect interfaces, functions of SDI and SW, and sensor data application program interfaces (APIs) to better manage climate modeling, geohazard, global changes, and other vital areas of attention and action.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

However, their association has been less examined, and their spatial relationship has been analyzed even less. This study contributes to a better understanding of the relationship between these three concepts (i.e., sense of place, social capital and civic engagement). Furthermore, we analyze the crucial role that the spatial relationship between them plays. Using spatial data collected through a web map-based application, we adopt structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques to assess the repercussion that sense of place has on social capital and how the latter affects civic engagement. We find that sense of place is significant and positively correlated with social capital, while the latter also significantly explains civic engagement at the individual level. Furthermore, we observe a better statistical performance in almost all cases when a spatial relationship between the three constructs exists. Our research leverages SEM techniques, Geographic Information Science (GISc) methods, and participatory methodology to show the spatial connection between sense of place and social capital to explain civic engagement. Deriving and quantifying such meaning allows us to highlight the importance of their spatial dimension in city processes such as participation.},

Thirteen EU Member States, not only in the Mediterranean region, but also in Central and Eastern Europe, have declared that they are affected by desertification. Desertification is a consequence, but also a cause of climate change: it is aggravated by more droughts, rising temperatures, less precipitation, and it also magnifies climate change by reducing the capacity of soil to retain carbon. Desertification is a cross cutting challenge for many EU policy areas such as climate, environment, agriculture, research and cohesion. EU support for combating desertification can be provided through several funding programmes from different policy areas, such as Rural Development, Environment, Cohesion or Research. The ECA is examining whether the risk of desertification is being addressed effectively and efficiently in the EU. The audit includes visits to EU projects addressing desertification in five Member States (Cyprus, Italy, Portugal, Romania and Spain), which are being used to assess the implementation and the monitoring of the EU’s desertification-related strategies.

In particular the theory of mediatization has proved fruitful for the analysis of how media spread to, become intertwined with, and influence other social institutions and cultural phenomena like politics, play and religion.
This book presents a major contribution to the theoretical understanding of the mediatization of culture and society. This is supplemented by in-depth studies of: • The mediatization of politics: From party press to opinion industry; • The mediatization of religion: From the faith of the church to the enchantment of the media; • The mediatization of play: From bricks to bytes; • The mediatization of habitus: The social character of a new individualism.
Mediatization represents a new social condition in which the media have emerged as an important institution in society at the same time as they have become integrated into the very fabric of social and cultural life. Making use of a broad conception of the media as technologies, institutions and aesthetic forms, Stig Hjarvard considers how characteristics of both old and new media come to influence human interaction, social institutions and cultural imaginations.},

We seek proposals dealing with any aspect of science in popular culture in any genre. We understand popular culture as both a textual and material practice, and thus welcome manuscripts dealing with representations of science in popular culture and those addressing the role of the cultural imagination in material encounters with science.

The results demonstrate that the same PPGIS attributes identified by points and polygons will converge on a collective spatial 'truth' within the study area provided there are enough observations, however, the degree of spatial convergence varies by PPGIS attribute type and the quantity of data collected. The use of points for mapping PPGIS attributes and aggregating areas through density mapping constitutes a conservative approach to spatial inference about place significance, but the data demands for point collection are considerably higher than for polygon features. Based on our results, we provide heuristic guidelines for future PPGIS research when using point or polygon spatial attributes. We argue that other variables such as the cognitive complexity of the PPGIS mapping process and stronger claims of external validity favor the use of point features, but these advantages must be weighed against the significantly higher sampling effort required. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

The aim of this special issue is: 1) To offer a critical state-of-the-art overview of empirical research; and 2) to explore whether social media and mobile technologies have measurable effects on citizens' engagement beyond traditional mobilization and participation tools. We find that wider engagement only ‘materializes’ if virtual connections also manifest themselves in real space through concrete actions, by using both online and offline engagement tools. Another requirement is that planners do not seek to marginalize dissenting voices in order to promote the interests of powerful developers.},

However, the participation practices in the real world, with its face-to-face politics of difference and unequal power relations, are flawed. Today, technology allows for an entirely new generation of forms and practices of public participation that promise to elevate the public discourse in an unprecedented manner while providing an interactive, networked environment for decision-making. This is occurring with asynchronous communities interacting with one another on a variety of planning subjects, which allows for more democratic planning and more meaningful participation. In this paper, we review the ways in which today's web-based virtual worlds, like Facebook and Second Life, provide platforms for public participation in planning in a manner distinct from previous formats. We explore the different ways that citizens and communities are using web-based technologies for citizen participation, including the use of Facebook for community organizing around planning issues and of Second Life for virtual workshops. We include case studies of communities that are using these tools. The paper concludes by exploring the contribution that virtual participation can make to planning and examines the challenges that it poses. © Taylor & Francis.},

Understanding that meaning shifts through an interplay of social, linguistic, and material interactions, GIS has the unique ability to show fluidity yet connectedness across geographic borders, providing intriguing opportunities as a research tool. Drawing on recent studies of GIS in research, we recognise the potential to build understanding of spatial context as both socially and politically constructed, but also the tendency to see a map as bounded data in finality. We argue here the importance to return the data back to the material itself in order to avoid reifying a flat, discursive representation of the material without claiming agency. Through the planning of a participatory project with GIS as a research tool, we consider the implications, cautions, and potential of using GIS as a fluid and incomplete representation of a moment in time and space that is also a path moving toward something else.},

Their roles and possible advancements according to the Digital Earth vision and implementation require investigations. This paper presents a review of the literature concerning geoportals and serves the following primary purposes. First, various geoportal approaches for discovering and accessing Earth observation data and geo-information, mainly with scientific purposes, are summarized according to their characteristics and functionalities. Second, current major challenges in geoportals are identified in terms of functionalities, technologies, and especially big data support, from geoportal cases of China. Finally, based on lessons learned from the international and Chinese geoportals, solutions and recommendations for the challenges in geoportals are proposed in terms of their architectures, services, and technologies. The results show that geoportals usually provide access to distributed data systems, offering maps, data discovery, and data downloads. Some of them are also capable of offering online analysis and processing service, enhanced semantic search engines, and dynamic visualization tools. The strength of geoportals could lead to a full-fledged online Digital Earth system that could provide better data sharing and dissemination solutions to the challenges posed by big data.},

It has a great value to automatically detect the geolocation from these reports for a better understanding of the associated events. Although various open-source and commercial tools exist to identify geolocation, they fail to identify at a granular level such as locality or city and they do not support most languages. Most of the techniques view the problem in terms of Named Entity Recognition (NER) and identify geolocation information at the country level for a given text. In this paper, we consider English, Spanish and Arabic news articles from different publishers. We define primary focus location as the actual location where the event occurred amongst other focus locations mentioned in the report. Our aim is to extract the primary focus location regardless of the language from articles belonging to different news agencies. We propose a mechanism to identify potential sentences containing focus locations using NER. After that, we perform sentence embedding over words from different languages and then employ a supervised classification mechanism to predict the primary focus location. We also perform bias correction over the training data using a suitable adaptation mechanism to reduce the sampling bias in training data. Our method trains a classifier using bias-corrected training data from news articles published by an agency in one language, while testing the model on news articles published by another agency in a different language. Our empirical results when compared to baseline approaches show superior performance on real-world English, Spanish and Arabic news articles.},

Variability, particularly systematic variability in location names (Carroll, 1983), challenges the identification task.

This permits evaluation of an observed n-gram in Twitter targeted text as a legitimate location name variant from the same location-context. Using n-gram statistics and location-related dictionaries, our Location Name Extraction tool (LNEx) handles abbreviations and automatically filters and augments the location names in gazetteers (handling name contractions and auxiliary contents) to help detect the boundaries of multi-word location names and thereby delimit them in texts. We evaluated our approach on 4,500 event-specific tweets from three targeted streams to compare the performance of LNEx against that of ten state-of-the-art taggers that rely on standard semantic, syntactic and/or orthographic features. LNEx improved the average F-Score by 33-179%, outperforming all taggers. Further, LNEx is capable of stream processing.},

Reliable geocoding of such articles is the first step towards unlocking such local knowledge for community engagement and development. However, existing geo-referencing methods and tools do not work well for local news because they do not reflect the ways local people encode and communicate geographical knowledge. This paper argues that local news requires a different method and infrastructure support for effective geo-referencing. To gain insights on the unique aspects of local gazetteers and the nature of ambiguities, we present an analysis of a collection of local new articles. We found that place references in local news have their special vocabulary, and that their ambiguities are handled differently by local people. We translated such insights into a gazetteer-based geocoding solution that combines progressive geocoding with a smart footprint recommender. Progressive geocoding service uses Nominatim (OpenStreetMap) as the initial gazetteer to jump-start the construction of local gazetteer for a community and by the community. LocusRecommender automatically suggests the best matches from gazetteer ranked by a set of heuristic rules. Preliminary evaluation shows that our smart footprint recommender predicts 80% of the answers by its top-three recommendations.},

As such, gold-standard annotated corpora underlie most advances in natural language processing (NLP).

The creation of geoparsing corpora that include both the recognition of place names in text and matching of those names to toponyms in a geographic gazetteer (a process we call geo-annotation), is a laborious, time-consuming and expensive task. The field lacks efficient geo-annotation tools to support corpus building and lacks design guidelines for the development of such tools. Here, we present the iterative design of GeoAnnotator, a web-based, semi-automatic and collaborative visual analytics platform for geo-annotation. GeoAnnotator facilitates collaborative, multi-annotator creation of large corpora of geo-annotated text by generating computationally-generated pre-annotations that can be improved by human-annotator users. The resulting corpora can be used in improving and benchmarking geoparsing algorithms as well as various other spatial language-related methods.

I mobilize affect as both a theoretical framework and an analytic to engage with geolocation as an instrumentality of intensities that organizes affects for platforms, which I term ‘platform affects’. I theorize platform affects as individual and collective orientations of attunement, predisposition, and/or incentivization towards using, contributing to, remaining within, and/or returning to platforms. Drawing on select empirical examples identified as part of a qualitative study, I identify that geolocation organizes five ‘platform affects’ for digital platform ecosystems: (i) affective space-times of hyperlocality and real-timeness; (ii) experiential affects of smoothness; (iii) affects of connectedness; (iv) affects of trust; and (v) affective value. Theorizing geolocation affectively adds explanatory power to the “dynamics driving the integration” of geolocation and digital systems (Alvaren León, 2016, p. 1). Simultaneously, engaging platforms via affects (of geolocation) advances an understanding of the ways in which platforms have come to secure and sustain prominence within dominant contemporary socialities defined by configurations of bodies, technologies, and other materialities that are themselves captured within and expressed through theories of affect (Clough, 2007).},

This is not simple when the data is unstructured as is the case when the data is a collection of documents such as news articles, which is the domain of discourse, where the spatial attribute consists of text that can be (but is not required to be) interpreted as the names of locations. In other words, spatial data is specified using text (known as a toponym) instead of geometry, which means that there is some ambiguity involved. The process of identifying and disambiguating references to geographic locations is known as geotagging and involves using a combination of internal document structure and external knowledge, including a document-independent model of the audience's vocabulary of geographic locations, termed its spatial lexicon. In contrast to previous work, a new spatial lexicon model is presented that distinguishes between a global lexicon of locations known to all audiences, and an audience-specific local lexicon. Generic methods for inferring audiences' local lexicons are described. Evaluations of this inference method and the overall geotagging procedure indicate that establishing local lexicons cannot be overlooked, especially given the increasing prevalence of highly local data sources on the Internet, and will enable the construction of more accurate spatial indexes. © 2010 IEEE.},

However, most articles are not explicitly geotagged with their geographic content, and few news aggregation systems expose this content to users. A new system named NewsStand is presented that collects, analyzes, and displays news stories in a map interface, thus leveraging on their implicit geographic content. NewsStand monitors RSS feeds from thousands of online news sources and retrieves articles within minutes of publication. It then extracts geographic content from articles using a custom-built geotagger, and groups articles into story clusters using a fast online clustering algorithm. By panning and zooming in NewsStand's map interface, users can retrieve stories based on both topical significance and geographic region, and see substantially different stories depending on position and zoom level. © 2008 Association for Computing Machinery.},

However, existing IR systems only recently began to offer local services and largely ignore geo-spatial information. This paper presents our work on automatically identifying the geographical scope of web documents, which provides the means to develop retrieval tools that take the geographical context into consideration. Our approach makes extensive use of an ontology of geographical concepts, and includes a system architecture for extracting geographic information from large collections of web documents. The proposed method involves recognising geographical references over the documents and assigning geographical scopes through a graph ranking algorithm. Initial evaluation results are encouraging, indicating the viability of this approach. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We depart from the conventional method and introduce a two-stage supervised machine-learning algorithm that evaluates each location mention to be either correct or incorrect. We extract contextual information from texts, i.e., N-gram patterns for location words, mention frequency, and the context of sentences containing location words. We then estimate model parameters using a training data set and use this model to predict whether a location word in the test data set accurately represents the location of an event. We demonstrate these steps by constructing customized geolocation event data at the subnational level using news articles collected from around the world. The results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing geocoders even in a case added post hoc to test the generality of the developed algorithm.},

In this environment, meeting sustainable development objectives and responding to Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are also complex and temporal processes which involving multiple stakeholders. The creation of economic wealth, social stability and environmental protection in line with MDGs can be achieved through the development of products and services based on spatial information collected by all levels of government. These goals and objectives can be facilitated through the development of a spatially enabled government and society, where location and spatial information are regarded as common goods made available to citizens and businesses to encourage creativity and product development. This requires data and services to be accessible and accurate, well-maintained and sufficiently reliable for use by the majority of society which is not spatially aware. Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs) as enabling platforms are being developed by many countries to improve access, sharing and integration of spatial data and services however, there are still many issues and challenges which need to be overcome in order to have a fully functioning platform. This paper aims to introduce and discuss various challenges and issues associated in re-engineering current SDI design to support the new vision on spatially enabled government and society. It also discusses the central role that an SDI as the enabling platform plays in facilitating data sharing and integration. The paper highlights a range of activities and processes to be created across all jurisdictional levels in order to facilitate such a platform design and development. This includes aspects of designing, creating and processes involved in development and in particular governance of an SDI platform.},

This has limited the progress of borderland-related research. In recent years, data collection technologies have developed greatly, especially geospatial Web 2.0 technologies including blogs, publish/subscribe, mashups, and GeoRSS, which provide opportunities for data acquisition in borderland areas. This paper introduces the design and development of a Geoweb-based tagging system that enables users to tag and edit geographical information. We first establish the GeoBlog model, which consists of a set of geospatial components, posts, indicators, and comments, as the foundation of the tagging system. GeoBlog is implemented such that blogs are mashed up with OpenStreetMap. Moreover, we present an improvement to existing publish/subscribe systems with support for spatio-temporal events and subscriptions, called Spatial Publish/Subscribe, as well as the event agency network for routing messages from the publishers to the subscribers. A prototype system based on this approach is implemented in experiments. The results of this study provide an approach for asynchronous interaction and message-ordered transfer in the tagging system.},

   abstract = {Event extraction from news articles is a commonly required prerequisite for various tasks, such as article summarization, article clustering, and news aggregation. Due to the lack of universally applicable and publicly available methods tailored to news datasets, many researchers redundantly implement event extraction methods for their own projects. The journalistic 5W1H questions are capable of describing the main event of an article, i.e., by answering who did what, when, where, why, and how. We provide an in-depth description of an improved version of Giveme5W1H, a system that uses syntactic and domain-specific rules to automatically extract the relevant phrases from English news articles to provide answers to these 5W1H questions. Given the answers to these questions, the system determines an article’s main event. In an expert evaluation with three assessors and 120 articles, we determined an overall precision of p=0.73, and p=0.82 for answering the first four W questions, which alone can sufficiently summarize the main event reported on in a news article. We recently made our system publicly available, and it remains the only universal open-source 5W1H extractor capable of being applied to a wide range of use cases in news analysis.},

   abstract = {Economic valuation of crop pollination services, including potential monetary losses in agricultural production induced by insufficient pollination, is a strategy to quantify the impacts of this critical ecosystem service on food production, food security and the global economy, and to drive policy actions. We examined how the economic valuation of crop pollination services has been investigated across the ecological and economics literature and review estimates of monetary values of crop pollination services, as well as the investments (research funding/grants) and policy actions associated with pollinators and pollination. We documented an increase in the number of economic valuation studies on pollination services in the last two decades, with a substantial growth over the last five years, which represented 54% of all publications. However, we emphasize that there is a marked lack of data on regionally important commercial crops that are essential for the food security of many millions of people, particularly in developing countries. Estimated global values of the crop pollination service, adjusted for inflation in March/2020, range widely from US$195 billion to ~US$387 (US$267–657) billion annually — due to methodology, input data and a historical increase in production costs of pollinator-dependent crops. There is an increasing trend over time in the values of crop pollination service estimates for the full set of main globally-grown crops, although estimates for specific crops are widely variable at local to regional scales. Research funding on pollination/pollinators is mainly in developed countries, which have published all the reviewed policy papers on the economic value of crop pollination services. Although the valuation of pollination services, and associated economics and policy remain embryonic areas of research, animal-mediated pollination is clearly a high-value environmental service, which greatly strengthens conservation arguments worldwide.},

   abstract = {Ecosystem services mapping and modeling has focused more on supply than demand, until recently. Whereas the potential provision of economic benefits from ecosystems to people is often quantified through ecological production functions, the use of and demand for ecosystem services has received less attention, as have the spatial flows of services from ecosystems to people. However, new modeling approaches that map and quantify service-specific sources (ecosystem capacity to provide a service), sinks (biophysical or anthropogenic features that deplete or alter service flows), users (user locations and level of demand), and spatial flows can provide a more complete understanding of ecosystem services. Through a case study in Puget Sound, Washington State, USA, we quantify and differentiate between the theoretical or in situ provision of services, i.e., ecosystems' capacity to supply services, and their actual provision when accounting for the location of beneficiaries and the spatial connections that mediate service flows between people and ecosystems. Our analysis includes five ecosystem services: carbon sequestration and storage, riverine flood regulation, sediment regulation for reservoirs, open space proximity, and scenic viewsheds. Each ecosystem service is characterized by different beneficiary groups and means of service flow. Using the ARtificial Intelligence for Ecosystem Services (ARIES) methodology we map service supply, demand, and flow, extending on simpler approaches used by past studies to map service provision and use. With the exception of the carbon sequestration service, regions that actually provided services to people, i.e., connected to beneficiaries via flow paths, amounted to 16-66% of those theoretically capable of supplying services, i.e., all ecosystems across the landscape. These results offer a more complete understanding of the spatial dynamics of ecosystem services and their effects, and may provide a sounder basis for economic valuation and policy applications than studies that consider only theoretical service provision and/or use. © 2014 by the author(s).},

Yet, critical assessment of systemic bias resulting from reliance on land use and landcover data is limited. Here, we evaluate an extensive collection of ecosystem service-related data based on land use and landcover according to a broadly applicable ecosystem service framework—Final Ecosystem Goods and Services (FEGS). In this framework, ecosystems are viewed from the perspective of a comprehensive set of beneficiaries and the biophysical features directly relevant to each. In this examination, we create a database identifying over 14,000 linkages between 255 data layers from EnviroAtlas and FEGS beneficiaries. Through these linkages, we identify major gaps in beneficiary identification and systemic biases resulting from the utilization of translations from land use and landcover data. Importantly, we find that for many beneficiaries there is an absence of data on FEGS at extensive scales in the United States. We provide a roadmap for the integration of extant ecosystem service research efforts using the FEGS classification scheme and critically appraise this scheme, highlighting inconsistent specification among beneficiary categories and environmental classes. We also explore the benefits of crosswalking different ecosystem service data and frameworks for researchers, by reducing the otherwise high buy-in cost of data exploration, and for data developers, by increasing the exposure of their work.},

The principles Mark Monmonier outlined back then remain true today, despite significant technological changes in the making and use of maps. The introduction and spread of digital maps and mapping software, however, have added new wrinkles to the ever-evolving landscape of modern mapmaking.

​Fully updated for the digital age, this new edition of How to Lie with Maps examines the myriad ways that technology offers new opportunities for cartographic mischief, deception, and propaganda. While retaining the same brevity, range, and humor as its predecessors, this third edition includes significant updates throughout as well as new chapters on image maps, prohibitive cartography, and online maps. It also includes an expanded section of color images and an updated list of sources for further reading. },
